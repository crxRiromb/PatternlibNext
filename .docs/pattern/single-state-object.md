# Single State Object

A single state object is a design pattern that encapsulates all the state and behavior of a component in a single object. 
This make it easier to manage state changes and keep track of the current state of the component,
e.g. for logging and debugging.

## When to Use

- When a component has complex state that is difficult to manage with multiple state variables and dependent items.

## When not to Use

- When a component's state is simple and can be easily managed with individual state variables.
