# Tooling/Build Setup

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.14.0) and npm (v10.9.2)

## Repo Organization

- Singleâ€‘Repo, multi Projects
- Separation of concerns with packages (Libraries) and apps
- Dependency of projects are managed via Tarballs (npm pack) instead of Symlinks (npm link).
- For Storybook Vite alias for the Lit source (hot-reload) are used during development, while wrappers/apps continue to consume the packed artifacts.
